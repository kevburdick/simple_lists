simple_lists

This Ruby on Rails(RoR) project allows an open website where users can create a "to do" list for all sorts of reasons. The project allows for dynamic lists to be created by a user and there is no specified predefined format to a new list with the exception that it adds the 'id'. 'created_at', and 'updated_at' columns to all lists. Anyone can view or update the set of lists with access to the website. The user can add, edit, and delete records. They can add, remove, or rename columns of an existing list. 
    The project currently has a PostgreSQL database on the back end. Capybara was used for blackbox testing which can be found in the integration folder under test. This gem helped the test effort and supports searching a webpage for a set of text and simulates selecting a button, or selecting a link.
